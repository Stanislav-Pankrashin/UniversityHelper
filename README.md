# UniversityHelper
A little Android based helper for calculating university GPA's and grades

# About
This project was created in my spare time while studying towards a Computer Science degree, 
it allows users to calculate their current GPA for a semester, and their grade in a paper, as well as the grade needed in their final exam to achieve a grade.

It has since been hosted on the google play store under the name "University Helper"
